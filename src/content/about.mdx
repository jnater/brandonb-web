# Hello!

My name is Brandon Boudreaux. I am a 3rd-year Physics major with a minor in
Mathematics at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. I am the Treasurer
of the Society of Physics Students Wayne State Chapter. I was born in Norco,
Louisiana, and relocated to the Detroit Metro Area in 2014. After I complete
my degree, I hope to continue my education in a Ph.D. program in pursuit of
physics.

Currently, I am an undergraduate research fellow of the JETSCAPE Collaboration developing machine learning replacement for quark-gluon plasma hydrodynamics simulations. View the 'Research' tab for more information!

I have a wide variety of interests that include, but are not limited to Video games, Meteorology, Mathematics, Physics, Electronics, 3D-Printing, Programming, Language Learning, Climate Activism, and much more! The 'Projects' tab includes a list of projects that are currently in the works.
